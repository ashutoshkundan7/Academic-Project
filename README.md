Bank Loan Case Study:

Project Overview:
This project aims to analyze loan applicant data to identify patterns that predict if a customer will have difficulty repaying their installments. Insights from this analysis can help banks make informed decisions on loan approvals, amounts, and interest rates, minimizing default risk.

Key Insights:
- Loan Re-payers: Most clients repay their loans on time.
- Gender Trends: The bank lends more to women, but men tend to default less.
- Age and Experience: Older clients with more experience are less likely to default.
- Loan Type: Most clients prefer cash loans.
- Education: Educated clients default less, so the bank should prioritize them.
- Family Size: Clients with more children are less likely to take loans.
- Unemployment: Unemployed clients have a higher default rate and larger credit amounts.
- Loan Amount vs Age: Older clients tend to take larger loans but default less.

Project Structure:
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, outliers, and imbalance.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing individual and relationships between features.
- Correlation Analysis: Identifying key feature correlations with loan defaults.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Excel
- Data Visualization - Tableau
- Sql
